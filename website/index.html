            <!-- <h3>About myself</h3> -->
          <p>Hi. If you are here right now and reading that what supposed to be few words
            about myself it means that was a reason you find the way to find my website.
            Everything happens for reason and there are many reasons why I'm here right now as
            well and why Wicked Gardens idea born in my crazy head. Let me introduce
            myself to you first. My name is Slawek what for many of you will be a very
            difficult name to prance so to make it easier for you and you still reading
            the story of my life few little changes in spelling and there you go Swavek
            now you should be able to say it right;) Many of my friends call me Max as
            it was easier for them. I'm originally from Poland but soon I would be able
            to say that nearly half
            of my life I live in London and trust me am not that young;) So as most of my
            friends know that I always choose the hardest possible ways in my life otherwise
            probably everything will start a long time ago. But like probably for most of
            you as well, the last 15th months give us lots of time to think about everything.</p>

          <p>I was working nonstop since I was 17, move out from my parents when
            I was 18 and learn life very quick from both sides the good one and
            the bad one. But I can't complain as that let me meet fantastic
            friends around the world on the way
            and without them, I won't be who I'm today. 24 years of work
            experience and am here still with lots of crazy ideas in my head:)
            Everything started four years ago in Brighton hospital when I open
            my eyes and take my third chance in my
            life( I hope I'm like cat. 4 to go) I promise myself few things that
            day one of them is this one (maybe not exactly in that form) but am
            very proud of myself that I make it happens and I would change it back.
            I ask myself that day would
            be the last thing I would like to achieve in my life to make it complete.
            The answer was to create a project where people love to work and have many
            possibilities. Every day at work will look different, your boss doesn’t treat
            you as the
            next person on the payroll or after working 10years for one company you never
            meet your boss in person.
          </p>

          <p>The idea is to create big magical things with respect to each other,
            a place where you can sing and no one tells you to be quiet but will
            sing with you. The place where you can be yourself. I'm one of this
            person who always gets what they
            want (what not always was the best idea). Not many people ever were
            able to change my decisions. Wicked Gardens are one of them as well.
            I love animals and they are a massive part of my life. I never will
            be rich as am giving away too much
            to others but I'm absolutely fine with that and always will if I
            can help as that makes me happy and that is a massive part of my
            life what I get from my mum. Life is not about money but about how
            do you feel and with who you can share it.
            (I'm single btw;)) Wicked Gardens is the first part of my project.
          <p>If I win the lottery (that would help for sure) hopefully next
            year if everything will go fine I would be able to open my own
            flowers design studio somewhere in a little place in the high
            street when every one of you will be able to pop
            in and say hello;). If you still reading I have to say am very
            impressed but Thank you so much for being part of my journey and please say hello if you like lets create magic together;)</p>
